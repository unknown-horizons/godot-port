============================================================
We are search dev for our Godot Engine Port.
We want to port because our current engine is really dead. The gui lib that we use is dead too and have alot of problems.
We really love our game and the comunity love it too.
We are searching:
Godot Coder/an graphic artist would be nice too because maybe we can reuse all graphics. We have alot blender files.
Later sound effect and music creator would be nice too.
An design document write would be really nice too. That our Wiki could get alot of more informations.

_Unknown Horizons_ is a 2D real time strategy simulation with an
emphasis on economy and city building. Expand your small
settlement to a strong and wealthy colony, collect taxes and
supply your inhabitants with valuable goods. Increase your
power with a well balanced economy and with strategic trade
and diplomacy.
