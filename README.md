**We are searching for developers for our [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) port**.
We want to port it because our current engine is basically dead.
The GUI lib that we use is also dead, and has a lot of problems.
We really love our game and the community loves it too.

We are looking for:

- Mainly, Godot programmers.
- A graphics artist would be handy, because maybe we can reuse
all previous graphic assets. We have a lot blender files.
- Later, a sound effects and music creator would be nice too.
- A design document writer would be really nice as well, so that
our [wiki](https://github.com/unknown-horizons/godot-port/wiki)
could get a lot of more information.
