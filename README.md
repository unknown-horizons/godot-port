**We are looking for developers for our [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) port**.
We want to port it because our current engine is basically dead.
The used GUI library is also dead with a lot of issues.
We really love our game and the community loves it too.

We are looking for:

- Mainly, Godot programmers.
- A graphics artist would be handy. For new assets but also to potentially rework existing graphical content. We have a lot of blender files.
- Later, a sound effects and music creator would be nice too.
- A design document writer would be really nice as well, so that
our [wiki](https://github.com/unknown-horizons/godot-port/wiki)
could get a lot of more information.

**Unknown Horizons** is a 2D real time strategy simulation with
an emphasis on economy and city building. Expand your small
settlement to a strong and wealthy colony, collect taxes and
supply your inhabitants with valuable goods. Increase your
power with a well balanced economy and with strategic trade
and diplomacy.

## Contributing

This project is based on Godot 4. Get it from [https://godotengine.org/download/](https://godotengine.org/download/), open the executable, import the project and you are good to go for developing and playtesting. No compilation needed!

Also consulate [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the project goals and further instructions regarding the setup and coding-related instructions. The Godot port is in an early experimental state with no playable content at this point of time and therefore no release date set in stone.

For that reason, please check out the [original project](https://github.com/unknown-horizons/unknown-horizons) which bears a decade long active development history with tons of implemented features and will provide you a better insight on the desired look and feel than any textual explanation could do (even more so if being unfamiliar with RTS games). Besides you should be able to grab existing logic and convert it appropriately for the Godot/GDScript style.
